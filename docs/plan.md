# CodeArt-LLM-CLI: Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

| **Project Name:**  | CodeArt-LLM-CLI |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| **Objective:**     | Develop a command-line interface for interacting with LLMs, enabling AI-assisted workflows for software development. |
| **Target Users:**  | Developers, engineering teams, and technical writers. |


## 2. Project Milestones & Timeline

### **Phase 1: Initial Development**

- Define high-level architecture and core concepts (Complete)
- Implement CLI command parsing
- Develop project, channel, and agent management
- Implement TOML-based configuration system
- Implement initial integration with OpenAI API

### **Phase 2: Core Features & Security**

- Implement tool execution framework with sandboxing and permission prompts
- Develop agent-to-agent collaboration within channels
- Implement file access whitelisting system
- Establish history and storage mechanisms (plain text, pluggable storage API)
- Introduce minimal caching for performance improvements

### **Phase 3: Enhancements & Testing**

- Support multiple LLM backends (e.g., Claude, Mistral)
- Implement dry-run mode for tool execution
- Improve UX with command listing (`/list` commands, defaults management)
- Conduct security and performance audits
- Perform extensive testing and refine user experience

### **Phase 4: Beta Release & Feedback Collection**

- Release beta version to early adopters
- Gather user feedback and refine features
- Implement fixes and improvements based on user testing
- Optimize performance and address bottlenecks

### **Phase 5: Stable Release & Future Roadmap**

- Launch stable v1.0 release
- Provide comprehensive documentation and usage guides
- Define future roadmap based on adoption and feedback

## 3. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                     | Impact | Mitigation                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope creep              | High   | Strict feature prioritization, iterative releases |
| Security vulnerabilities | High   | Regular security audits, sandboxed execution      |
| Performance issues       | Medium | Introduce caching, optimize execution flows       |
| Adoption challenges      | Medium | Provide extensive documentation, collect feedback |

## 4. Success Metrics

- CLI execution response time remains under 200ms for standard queries
- At least 50% of beta users adopt it for daily workflows
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials available at launch
- Positive feedback on agent collaboration and tool execution features

## 5. Future Considerations

- Expand storage formats beyond plain text
- Support agent-driven workflow automation
- Introduce role-based permissions for tool execution
- Improve async processing for background tasks
